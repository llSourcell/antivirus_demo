# Antivirus Demo

Overview
============
This project helps train a classifier to be able to detect [PE files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable) as either malicious or legitimate. It tries out 6 different classification algorithms before deciding which one to use for prediction by comparing their results. This is the code for 'Build an Antivirus in 5 Min' on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/iLNHVwSu9EA).


Dependencies
============

* pandas ```pip install pandas```
* numpy ```pip install numpy```
* pickle ```pip install pickle```
* scipy ```pip install scipy```
* scikit ```pip install -U scikit-learn```

Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies

Basic Usage
===========

1. Run ```python learning.py``` to train the model. It will train on the dataset included called 'data.csv'.

2. Once trained you can test the model via ```python checkpe.py YOUR_PE_FILE```. It will output either malicious or legitimate!

That's it!

Alternative Usage 
===========

You can also use the jupyter notebook provided in this repo to have a little more interactivity with the learning script. Simply run ```jupyter notebook virus_classifier.ipynb``` 
Credits
===========
Credit for the vast majority of code here goes to [Te-k](https://github.com/Te-k). I've merely created a wrapper around all of the important functions to get people started.
